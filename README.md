SmugSaver
=========

This is Java Swing application, written in January 2007.  It will download all photos from a SmugMug album, in high resolution format.  This was useful to me back in 2007 because I could send this app to my friends and let them easily download all the photos in one of my albums.  It isn't all that useful anymore (2013) because SmugMug has added their own "download all as a zip file" feature.

This app uses SmugMug's REST API to get the list of photos in album.
